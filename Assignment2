Let's illustrate ACID properties with an online shopping scenario:

1.Atomicity: If a customer adds multiple items to their cart, atomicity ensures that either all
items are successfully added to the order or none are. If there's an issue with any item (like 
being out of stock), the entire transaction is canceled to prevent incomplete orders.

2.Consistency: Imagine a rule where customers can't place orders exceeding their credit limit.
Consistency ensures this rule is enforced before finalizing the transaction. If the order surpasses 
the credit limit, the transaction is declined to maintain consistency and prevent overspending.

3.Isolation: Consider two customers making purchases at the same time. Isolation ensures that 
each transaction is separate from the other. Even if transactions occur simultaneously, they shouldn't 
interfere with each other. For example, one customer's actions shouldn't affect another's ability to browse
or buy items.

4.Durability: Once a customer completes a purchase and payment is processed, the order details
should be securely stored permanently. Durability ensures that transaction data remains intact and accessible,
even if there's a system failure. This ensures customers can access their order history, and the store maintains
accurate records regardless of technical issues.

In essence, ACID properties, applied to an online shopping context, ensure reliable and secure transactions 
by ensuring atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.
